## About the Course

### Course Overview

Welcome to Data Science Society at Berkeley’s very own DeCal: Introduction to Real World Data Science, a semester-long course geared towards introducing students to essential data science skills through project-based learning. Our program takes a departure from the traditional classroom setting by allowing members to work collaboratively on an original data science project of their choosing. Members will have full creative control and will receive mentorship from our Decal’s Academic Development members. We will cover every step of the data science lifecycle: from formulating a data-centric project idea, to extracting stories with exploratory data analysis, to finally creating and evaluating machine learning models.

This introductory course covers a wide variety of data science concepts, both traditionally and not traditionally taught in the lecture halls of Berkeley. We aim to give students programming expertise by providing engaging lessons going through the data science lifecycle while they work through the project lifecycle themselves in a semester-long project.

In this course, not only will students develop and hone their technical expertise, they will also experience data science in the real world through panels and speaker events. All this and more will challenge students and elevate them in the search for post-graduate opportunities, while still maintaining the low-pressure environment of a DeCal that values learning above all else.

This class is an application-based, 2-unit P/NP course with an emphasis on concepts that requires minimal background and acts as a hands-on supplement to those interested in learning data science at UC Berkeley. It will consist of a project (undergoing the entire data science lifecycle) that will help you build up your portfolio.  The course is graded on satisfactory completion of this project. There will be a few supplemental checkpoints and weekly quizzes. 

### Learning Outcomes 
* Understand the data science lifecycle and develop core skills in data manipulation, visualization, modeling and testing in order to make predictions and answer real-world questions.
* Synthesize the data science concepts and apply them collaboratively in industry settings.
* Develop the ability to communicate complex data-based procedures and findings to academic peers.
* Understand how to ideate an original project based on personal curiosity and data gathering.




### Prerequisites

The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students who have not previously taken statistics, computer science, and data science courses. Students with some prior experience in computing are welcome to enroll, and often find that this course offers a new perspective that blends computational and inferential thinking. Students who have taken several statistics or computer science courses should instead take a more advanced course like [Data 100](https://ds100.org/).


### Support

You are not alone in this DATA 198: Introduction to Real World Data Science the staff and instructors are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions.

Your TA and tutor will be your main point of contact for all course related questions/grade clarifications. The TAs and tutors are here to support you so please lean on your lab TA if you need more support in the class or have any questions/concerns.

**Important Note**: We don’t use any personal or Berkeley emails to handle **Decal logistics** or requests. Any emails of this form to Facilitator’s or TA’swill be disregarded. 
- For personal inquiries during the semester, please message your TA on private messaging platforms or their personal Berkeley email.
- For inquiries before or after the semester, email dss.data198@gmail.com


## Course Components

### Live Lecture

Live lectures will be held from **TBD**; students are expected to attend live lectures synchronously. We will not be recording these, unless enforced otherwise by university guidelines. Slides and lecture examples will be provided on the course website.

<!-->
### Assignments and Projects

Bi-weekly homework assignments are a required part of the course. You must complete and submit your homework independently, but you are allowed to discuss problems with other students and course staff. See the [Learning Cooperatively](#learning-cooperatively) section below.

Homeworks will be **released on Tuesday and Friday**, and are **due that same Friday and the following Tuesday night, respectively**.

Data science is about analyzing real-world data sets, and so you will also complete two projects involving real data. On each project, you may work with a single partner; your partner must be from the lab you enrolled in. Both partners will receive the same score.

If you submit a homework or project 24 hours before the deadline or earlier, you will receive 5 bonus points on that assignment.

### Exams

The midterm exam will be held on **Friday, July 12 from 11am-1pm PT**. Please note the date and time carefully.

The final exam is required for a passing grade, and will be held on **Wednesday, August 7 from 11am-1pm PT**.

There will be **no alternate exams** for the midterm and the final exam for those with exam conflicts. If you have exam accommodations on file with the DSP office, they will be taken into account for both the midterm and final exams.

## Grades

Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components. 

| **Activity** | **Grade** |
| Attendance | 30% |
| Assignments | 35% |
| Final Projects | 35% |

### Attendance 

This class will be difficult to follow if you do not keep up with the material. Prior to each class, you should review previous material and be engaged in class discussion. Attendance will be taken strictly during the class. You will be expected to attend the DeCal. The main way we will be taking attendance is through an attendance form that you will fill out during class time. 

The first two meetings of the DeCal are **mandatory**, no exceptions. If you miss any of the first two meetings, your spot will be taken by the next person on the waitlist.

Up to two unexcused absences are allowed without penalty. Excused attendances (i.e. family emergencies, midterm conflicts, medical reasons) should be approved by facilitators at least 24 hours prior to the class time: 

1) to your mentor and/or 
2) to the dss.data198@gmail.com email explaining your absence.



### Assignments 

In order to properly pace students through the final project, there will be 7 assignments in total: 5 project checkpoints and 2 reflections. Completing these assignments is essential in doing well on the final project, and ultimately the DeCal.

### Final Project 

Over the course of the semester, along with the support of their TAs and tutors, students will work on a data science project in a domain of their choice from start to finish and will be expected to present their work at the end of the semester at a final research symposium. 

Projects are an essential component to any technical course, especially one that aims to synthesize computing with real-world applications.

The project for this class will be graded on three points: Content, Presentation, and Collaboration.

Projects are designed to be open-ended and encourage students to think critically every step of the way: from the dataset(s) they choose, to the visualization techniques they employ. This allows for students to experience a date science domain of their choosing, while still grounding themselves in the material of the course.


**Late project submissions are deducted 10% for every day they are late.**

**No submissions of any kind will be accepted after May 3rd to provide course staff with enough time to grade before the deadline to submit final grades.**

**Reminder:** This course is 2 unit P/NP and a grade of 70% or higher is required to pass the course.

## Assignments

### Submitting Assignments

All assignments (homework, labs, and projects) will be submitted on Gradescope. Please refer to [this tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-H2NCyC01SL8P2rkyiz7-AYFXE11HCD/view?usp=sharing) for submitting assignments.

### Late Submission

**The deadline for all assignments in this course is 11 PM PT**. Assignments submitted **until 11:59 PM** on the day of the deadline will not be marked as late. **Homework and lab submissions after this time <span style="text-decoration: underline">will not be accepted</span>**.

We understand that life happens. For this reason, **your two lowest homework scores and two lowest lab scores will be dropped in the calculation of your overall grade.** If you have an ongoing situation that prevents you from completing course content, please contact your lab TA.

Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late. Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, and projects submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit. Projects submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit.

### Assignment Extensions

Due to the fast pace of the summer offering, **we are unable to offer assignment extensions for the vast majority of students.** As mentioned above, you are provided two lab and homework drops for emergency situations that may come up. Only after using all your assignment drops, if you continue to encounter further emergencies beyond your control, please do not hesitate to reach out. Please fill out the [Extenuating Circumstances Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuJXqPqocHgYd1SLx2GryGVUhcA6_OzDtYZvbhek3La65KxA/viewform), and a course staff member will reach out to you and provide a space for conversation, as well as to arrange accommodations as necessary. Note that you will be asked to provide supporting documentation, and these requests will be approved on a case-by-case basis.

# Supervision & Responsibility of Instructor of Record

1) The Instructor of Record for DATA 198 - Introduction to Real-World Data Science will be Prof. Zachary Pardos
2) The lecturers will share instructional materials with the Instructor of Record, via email/Google Drive, at least two weeks before the instruction, and expect to get feedback, via email/comments on materials within a week. 
    * The lecturers will then have ~5 days to revise and rehearse for new materials.
3) The lecturers will schedule meetings with the Instructor of Record, at least a week before instruction begins, to seek advice and/or explanation on confusing/uncertain concepts.
4) Our Instructor of Record will also help with creating bCourses site, if necessary. If eventually the lecturers decide to use Git/GitHub purely, Instructor of Record will be invited to join the repository. 
5) The Instructor of Record also holds the responsibility for supervising the awarding of all final grades and for reporting the grades to the Office of the Registrar. The lecturers choose to use the same end-of-semester course evaluation form as that being used by the Instructor of Record for his other course(s). Our Instructor of Record is welcomed to do in-class observations, and to give any help/suggestion during break. Our Instructor of Record agrees to help with any other unforeseeable issues if needed, unless he sees his involvements being inappropriate. 


### Learning Cooperatively

We encourage you to discuss course content with your friends and classmates as you are working on your assignments. No matter your academic background, you will learn more if you work alongside others than if you work alone. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

If some emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don’t just disappear silently! You should inform your lab TA and your project partner (if you have one) immediately, so that nobody is expecting you to do something you can’t finish.


## Academic Honesty

You must write your answers in your own words, and you must not share your completed work. The exception to this rule is that you can share everything related to a project with your project partners and turn in one project between all of you. 

Please read Berkeley's [Code of Conduct](https://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct) carefully. Penalties for academic misconduct in are severe and include reporting to the [Center for Student Conduct](https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct). They might also include a NP in the course or even dismissal from the university. It's just not worth it!

When you need help, reach out to your TA and tutor. **You are not alone in Data 8!** Instructors and staff are here to help you succeed. We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you.

Finally, know that it's normal to struggle. Berkeley has high standards, which is one of the reasons its degrees are valued. Everyone struggles even though many try not to show it. Even if you don't learn everything that's being covered, you'll be able to build on what you do learn, whereas if you cheat you'll have nothing to build on. You aren't expected to be perfect; it's ok not to get an A.

## A Parting Thought

The main goal of the course is that you should learn, and have a fantastic experience doing so. Please keep that goal in mind throughout the semester. Welcome to Data 198: Introduction to Real World Data Science!
