bio: Helloo, I'm Siddharth! I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science and Data Science from Fremont. This is my fifth semester in DSS :D but I took the DeCal in Fall 2021 and loved my experience. In my free time, I like playing basketball, taking selfies with llamas, and being DSS's resident Professor Adhikari fan! I'm looking forward to meeting everyone and seeing another semester of great projects!!
